1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] is a protocol that is used to provide addressing and
   configuration information to IPv6 hosts.  The DHCPv6 protocol uses
   several identifiers that could become a source for gleaning
   additional information about the IPv6 host.  This information may
   include device type, operating system information, location(s) that
   the device may have previously visited etc.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Identifiers in DHCPv6

   There are several identifiers used in DHCPv6.  This section provides
   an introduction to the various options that will be used further in
   the document.

3.1.  DUID

   Each DHCPv6 client and server have a DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID)
   [RFC3315].  The DUID is designed to be unique across all DHCP clients
   and servers, and to remain stable after it has been initially
   generated.  The DUID can be of different forms.  Commonly used forms
   are based on the link-layer address of one of the device's network
   interfaces (with or without a timestamp), on the Universally Unique
   IDentifier (UUID) [RFC6355].  The default type, recommeded by
   [RFC3315], is DUID-LLT that is based on link-layer address, which is
   commonly impelemented in most popular clients.

   It is important to understand DUID lifecycle.  Clients and servers
   are expected to generate their DUID once (during first operation) and
   store it in a non-volatile storage or use the same deterministic
   algorithm to generate the same DUID value again.  This means that
   most implementations will use the available link-layer address during
   its first boot.  Even if the administrator enables privacy extensions
   (see [RFC4941]) and its equivalent for link-layer address
   randomization, it is likely that those privacy mechanisms were
   disabled during the first device boot.  Hence the original,
   unobfuscated link-layer address will likely end up being announced as
   client DUID, even if the link-layer address has changed (or even if
   being changed on a periodic basis).

3.2.  Client ID Option

   The Client Identifier Option (OPTION_CLIENTID) is used to carry the
   DUID of a DHCPv6 client between a client and a server.  There is an
   analogous Server Identifier Option but it is not of much interest in
   the privacy context (unless a host can be convinced to start acting
   as a server).  Client ID is an example of DUID.  See Section 3.1 for
   relevant discussion about DUIDs.

Internet-Draft         DHCP Privacy considerations        September 2014


3.3.  IA_NA, IA_TA and the IA Address Options

   The Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (IA_NA) option
   [RFC3315] is used to carry the parameters and any non-temporary
   addresses associated with the given IA_NA.  The IA_TA option is
   analogous to the IA_NA option but for temporary addresses.  The IA
   Address option is used to specify IPv6 addresses associated with an
   IA_NA or an IA_TA and is encapsulated within the Options field of
   such an IA_NA or IA_TA option.

   To differentiate between instances of the same type of IA containers,
   each IA_NA, IA_TA and IA_PD options have an IAID field that is unique
   for each client/option type pair.  It is up to the client to pick
   unique IAID values.  At least one popular implementation uses last
   four octets of the link-layer address.  In most cases, that means
   that merely two bytes are missing for a full link-layer address
   reconstruction.  However, the first three octets in a typical link-
   layer address are vendor identifier.  That can be determined with
   high level of certainty using other means, thus allowing full link-
   layer address discovery.

3.4.  Interface ID

   A DHCPv6 relay includes the Interface ID [RFC3315] option to identify
   the interface on which it received the client message thatis being
   relayed.

   Although in principle Interface ID can be arbitrarily long with
   completely random values, it is often a text string.  It often
   includes relay agent name followed by interface name.  This can be
   used for fingerprinting the relay or determining client's point of
   attachement.

3.5.  Subscriber ID

   A DHCPv6 relay includes a Subscriber ID option [RFC4580] to associate
   some provider-specific information with clients' DHCPv6 messages that
   is independent of the physical network configuration.

   In many deployments, the relay agent that inserts this option, is
   configured to use client's link-layer address as Subscriber ID.

3.6.  Remote ID

   A DHCPv6 relay includes a Remote ID option [RFC4649] to identify the
   remote host end of the circuit.

Internet-Draft         DHCP Privacy considerations        September 2014


3.7.  FQDN Option

   The Client FQDN option [RFC4704] is used by DHCPv6 clients and
   servers to exchange information about the client's fully qualified
   domain name.  In most case a client sends its hostname as a hint for
   the server.

3.8.  Client Link-layer Address Option

   The Client link-layer address option [RFC6939] is used by first-hop
   DHCPv6 relays to provide the client's link-layer address towards the
   server.

3.9.  Option Request Option

   DHCPv6 clients include an Option Request option in DHCPv6 messages to
   inform the server about options the client wants the server to send
   to the client.

3.10.  Vendor Class Option

   This option is used by a DHCPv6 client to identify the vendor that
   manufactured the hardware on which the client is running.

3.11.  Civic Location Option

   DHCPv6 servers use the Civic Location Option [RFC4776] to convey the
   civic and postal addresses to DHCPv6 clients.

4.  Existing Mechanisms That Affect Privacy

   This section describes available DHCPv6 mechanisms that one can use
   to protect or enhance one's privacy.

4.1.  Temporary addresses

   [RFC3315] defines temporary addresses.  The original idea behind
   temporary addresses was that a client may request a temporary
   address, use it for whatever purpose, never renew it and let it
   expire soon.  This concept could work in principle.  Client that
   wants to conceal its identity just keeps requesting new, short lived
   temporary addresses.

   There are number of serious issues, both protocolar and
   implementational, that make them nearly useless for their original
   goal.  First, [RFC3315] does not include T1 and T2 renewal timers in
   IA_TA (a container for temporary addresses).  However, it mentions
   that temporary addresses can be renewed.  Many client implementations



Krishnan & Mrugalski     Expires March 28, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         DHCP Privacy considerations        September 2014


   renew those addresses during a renewal procedure initiated by other
   resources (non-temporary addresses or prefixes), thus forfeiting
   shortliveness.  Second, [RFC4704] allows servers to update DNS for
   assigned temporary addresses.  Publishing client's IPv6 address in
   DNS that is publicly available is a major privacy breach.

4.2.  DNS Updates

   DNS Updates [RFC4704] defines a mechanism that allows both clients
   and server to insert into DNS domain information about clients.  Both
   forward (AAAA) and reverse (PTR) resource records can be updated.
   This allows other nodes to conveniently refer to a host, despite the
   fact that its IPv6 address may be changing.

   This mechanism exposes two important pieces of information: current
   address (which can be mapped to current location) and client's
   hostname.

5.  Attacks

5.1.  Finding device type

   The type of device used by the client can be guessed by the attacker
   using the Vendor Class Option, the Client Link-layer Address Option,
   and by parsing the Client ID Option.

5.2.  Finding operating system

   The operating system running on a client can be guessed using the
   Vendor Class Option, or by using fingerprinting techniques on the
   combination of options requested using the Option Request Option.

5.3.  Finding civic address information

   The civic address can be obtained by the attacker by many means.  The
   most direct way to obtain this information is by looking into a
   server initiated message that contains the Civic Location Option.  It
   can also be indirectly infered using the Remote ID Option (e.g. using
   a telephone number), the Interface ID option (e.g. if an access
   circuit on an Access Node corresponds to a civic location), or the
   Subscriber ID Option (if the attacker has access to subscriber info).

5.4.  Finding previously visited networks

   When DHCPv6 clients to a network they attempt to request the same
   address they had before they attached to a network.  They do this by
   putting the previously assigned address in the IA Address Options

Internet-Draft         DHCP Privacy considerations        September 2014


   inside the IA_NA, IA_TA.  By observing these addresses, an attacker
   can identify the network the client had previously visited.

5.5.  Finding a stable identity

   An attacker might use a stable identity gleaned from DHCPv6 messages
   to correlate activities of a given client on unrelated networks.  The
   Client FQDN option, the Subscriber ID Option and the Client ID
   options can serve as long lived identifiers of DHCPv6 clients.  The
   Client FQDN option can also provide an identity that can easily be
   correlated with web server activity logs.

5.6.  Pervasive monitoring

   This is an enhancement, or a combination of most aforementioned
   mechanisms.  Operator who controls non-trivial number of access
   points or network sergments, may use obtained information about a
   single client and observer client's habits.

5.7.  Finding client's IP address or hostname

   Many DHCP deployments use DNS Updates [RFC4704] that put client's
   information (current IP address, client's hostname).  Client ID is
   also disclosed, ableit in not easily accessbile form (SHA-256 digest
   of the client-id).  Although SHA-256 is irreversible, so DHCID can't
   be converted back to client-id.  However, SHA-256 digest can be used
   as a unique identifier that is accessible by any host.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

7.  Privacy Considerations

   This document at its entirety discusses privacy considerations in
   DHCPv6.  As such, no separate section about this is needed.

8.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions required.
